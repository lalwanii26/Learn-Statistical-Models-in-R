Dataset: Passenger car mileage
-  We consider the 04cars dataset (See description online)
- For now, we focus on the following variables:
1. mpg Highway gas consumption (miles per gallon)
2. hp Horsepower
3. wt Weight (pounds)
4. len Length (inches)
5. wd Width (inches)
- Goal: Predict a carâ€™s gas consumption based on these characteristics
